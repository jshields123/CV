## Jack Shields

A full stack Ruby developer in training with a thirst for a challenge, and getting them by the truckload at Makers Academy. This is where I aim to switch sides and transform from a tech recruiter into a fully fledged full stack developer. The pace of change in tech reflects my own drive to develop and learn about the world around us. I am keen to combine this drive, with my first class communication skills and a sound technical ability.

A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what excites you about tech.
