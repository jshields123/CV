Whilst living in Australia I found myself starved of a challenge and so decided to dive head first into something new. Coming from a background in tech recruitment, I was exposed to the IT industry. Fast forward 6 months I am a Full Stack Developer in JavaScript with my days full of challenging problems to solve. Graduating from Makers Academy bootcamp equipped me with the tools to supercharge my learning style, which allowed me to write clean, testable code, and be able to pick up any new language and technology and run with it.

The pace of change in tech reflects my own drive to continuously develop and learn about the world around us. I am keen to contribute my combination of drive, first class communication skills and a constantly improving technical knowledge, to a company that places real value in this skillset.

## Skills

#### Problem Solving
In a recent process review with an experienced web developer I was given a scenario of talking to a client to gather information of their needs and problem, and provide solution to this issue within a tight 45 mins timeframe. To put myself in the best position to best meet the clients needs, I took in as much information as possible with clear and probing communication skills, converted that into user stories and requirements, then created tests. I then used my failing tests as a base to develop a solution that was lean and that solved the main issues that the client was facing.

Not only was solving the problem the client had in real time truly satisfying, it also came with the positive reviewer feedback which is attached in the link below.

#### Communication
During the process of creating a market finder app I demonstrated my ability to effectively communicate through pair programming daily, leading the team in two day sprints and even leading daily dance classes to keep energy and morale up. Teamwork was a massive aspect of this project and I find this is when I come alive. I have the ability to see the strengths of others and how they can work best together. I am forthcoming with feedback to benefit the team and vocal, to lead and contribute, in decision making. This led to a positive team environment and this culminated with the project ending with a demo presentation in front of 75+ people. I presented how we worked well in a team and the process we took. I clearly put across the information required along with some humour to keep the audience engaged.

The demo was recorded and is a link is provided below.

#### Attention to Detail
Attention to detail has been a skill that I have developed over many years across multiple roles. From being a System Expert as part of my varied role at Hays where I was tasked with educating others on data integrity, how to effectively use in house tools and cleaning our data. The impact on efficiency was regularly measured with stats from across the business. 
From my time at Makers I realised early on that syntax errors and code layout were essential to both readability and reliability of my code. When writing a testing framework in JS for a NotesApp I realised that providing as detailed information as possible to failing test was essential. It gave me a real appreciation for those developers that write popular testing frameworks and that enables developers like us to write truly clean and stable code. 


#### Dedication and Work Ethic
I pride myself on determination to a complete a task or goal. This was the case as a recruiter, I would structure my week in advance to fit in the sheer quantity of tasks. By no means was it a 9-5 job, that has now become the norm to me. My resilience has been battle-worn in previous roles in sales and recruitment, and this mental toughness is an asset working in software engineering; in particular error handling.

Whilst attending Makers Academy I brought this work ethic with me. The course requires a growth mindset for self-led learning and focuses on equipping yourself with the tools to learn anything programming related, autonomously. This coupled with my resilience, positively contributed, for example towards the end of the course, I pushed the idea to the group of working through the weekend in order to accelerate our app to stand out. This dedication is born out of an unrelenting willingness to succeed. I truly believe this is a trait that adds significant value to a team environment.

## Experience

#### Makers Academy - London (Remote) - 01/2021 to 03/2021  
#### Makers Student

-  Makers Academy is a full stack developer bootcamp that challenges you to push beyond your own perceived limits, to develop skills at a rapid pace. I thoroughly enjoyed the course that involved acquiring skills to learn core principles of developing software (OOP, TDD,MVC, DDD) and applying those to many new languages (JavaScript, Ruby, HTML, CSS, SQL), technologies (React, React Native, Express, MongoDB) and frameworks (Bootstrap, Next.js, Node.js, Rails).
-  The course allowed me to develop both the self-led learning techniques and also extensive experience with working in agile groups and pair programming. The TDD approach to writing code is engrained in the ethos of the course and so now being a “Maker”, I to wholeheartedly believe in this philosophy. The testing frameworks we used were Rspec, Jest, Jasmine and actually developed our own testing framework.
-  In the larger projects such as creating a Facebook clone and developing our own Market finder app we worked in two day sprints for a two week period, working through the weekend. This was invaluable experience and resulted in developing and deploying apps via Heroku and CircleCI. 

#### Hays Recruitment - Sydney - 09/2016 to 09/2020  
#### Senior Recruitment Consultant

-  I recruited in both the IT Projects and Business Change and the Logistics and Supply Chain team covering both permanent and contract positions within the private sector. I started out with no prior recruitment experience and developed into a valuable senior recruiter across two teams.
-  This role gave me deep insight into the IT projects industry and fuelled my desire to pursue a career directly in technology. It also gave me an immense work ethic and ability to work well in a team, along with hitting targets solo.
-  My ability to learn and get up to speed rapidly with each different company and job I recruited for required was excellent and essential once again to my success. 
-  I was in communication with 100s of candidates and clients per week and develop effective relationships with each of them to meet mutually beneficial goals.

#### Thomson Reuters Legal - Sydney - 08/2015 to 09/2016  
#### Customer & Tech Care Consultant

- This role required me to develop my knowledge of products such as SAP and Salesforce along with a range of Thomson Reuters specific platforms. I then used this knowledge to provide assistance to customers through a variety of different avenues.
- My ability to communicate effectively with customers and internal stakeholders again proved integral to the success in this role and is something that I am very proud of.
- It was my first role directly within the IT industry. This appealed to my hunger for a challenge and need to constantly challenge myself. To go from inexperienced in this field, to competent after a sharp learning curve feels very rewarding.
