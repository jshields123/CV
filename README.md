## Jack Shields CV

A Junior Full Stack Developer in Ruby and JavaScript with a thirst for a challenge, and recently got them by the truckload at Makers Academy where I graduated their bootcamp. This is where I switched sides and transformed from a tech recruiter into a fully fledged full stack developer. The pace of change in tech reflects my own drive to develop and learn about the world around us. I am keen to combine this drive, with my first class communication skills and a continuously improving technical knowledge.

## Experience

Makers Academy - London (Remote) - 01/2021 to 03/2021  
Makers Student

Hays Recruitment - Sydney - 09/2016 to 09/2020  
Senior Recruitment Consultant

-  I recruited in both the IT Projects and Business Change and the Logistics and Supply Chain team covering both permanent and contract positions within the private sector. I started out with no prior recruitment experience and developed into a valuable senior recruiter across two teams.
-  This role gave me deep insight into the IT projects industry and fuelled my desire to pursue a career directly in technology. It also gave me an immense work ethic and ability to work well in a team, along with hitting targets solo.

Thomson Reuters Legal - Sydney - 08/2015 to 09/2016  
Customer & Tech Care Consultant

- This role required me to develop my knowledge of products such as SAP and Salesforce along with a range of Thomson Reuters specific platforms. I then used this knowledge to provide assistance to customers through a variety of different avenues.
- It was my first role directly within the IT industry. This appealed to my hunger for a challenge and need to constantly challenge myself. To go from inexperienced in this field, to competent after a sharp learning curve feels very rewarding.

- Sales
- Account management


#### Problem Solving

In a recent process review with an experienced web developer I was given a scenario of talking to a client to gather information of their needs and problem, and provide solution to this issue within a tight 45 mins timeframe. To put myself in the best position to best meet the clients needs, I took in as much information as possible with clear and probing communication skills, converted that into user stories and requirements, then created tests. I then used my failing tests as a base to develop a solution that was lean and that solved the main issues that the client was facing.

Not only was solving the problem the client had in real time truly satisfying, it also came with the positive reviewer feedback which is attached in the link below.

#### Communication
During the process of creating a market finder app I demonstrated my ability to effectively communicate through pair programming daily, leading the team in two day sprints and even leading daily dance classes to keep energy and morale up. This project ended with a demo presentation in front of 75+ people. I presented how we worked well in a team and the process we took. I clearly put across the information required along with some humour to keep the audience engaged.

The demo was recorded and is a link is provided below.
