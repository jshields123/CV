## Jack Shields CV

A Junior full stack Developer in Ruby and JavaScript with a thirst for a challenge, and recently got them by the truckload at Makers Academy where I graduated their bootcamp. This is where I switched sides and transformed from a tech recruiter into a fully fledged full stack developer. The pace of change in tech reflects my own drive to develop and learn about the world around us. I am keen to combine this drive, with my first class communication skills and a continuously improving technical knowledge.

## Experience

Makers Academy - London (Remote) - 01/01/2021 to 26/3/2021
Makers Student

Hays Recruitment - Sydney - 26/9/2016 to 1/09/2020  
Senior Recruitment Consultant

-  I recruited in both the IT Projects and Business Change and the Logistics and Supply Chain team covering both permanent and contract positions within the private sector. I started out with no prior recruitment experience and developed into a valuable senior recruiter across two teams.
-  This role gave me deep insight into the IT projects industry and fuelled my desire to pursue a career directly in technology. It also gave me an immense work ethic and ability to work well in a team, along with hitting targets solo.

Thomson Reuters Legal - Sydney - 11/08/2015 to 23/9/2016
Customer & Tech Care Consultant

- This role required me to develop my knowledge of products such as SAP and salesforce along with a range of Thomson Reuters specific platforms. I then used this knowledge to provide assistance to customers through a variety of different avenues
- It was my first role directly within the IT industry. This appealed to my hunger for a challenge and need to constantly challenge myself. To go from inexperienced in this field, to competent after a sharp learning curve feels very rewarding.

Various Sales and Customer Service roles - UK - 2012 to 2015


## Skills

- Attention to detail
- Problem solving
- Teamwork
- Communication
- Dedication and work ethic
- Sales
- Account management

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.

#### Problem Solving

In a recent process review with an experienced web developer I was given a scenario of talking to a client to gather information of their needs and problem, and TDD a answer to this issue within a tight 45 mins timeframe. To put myself in the best position to best meet the clients needs I took in as much information as possible, converted that into user stories and requirements and then tests. I then used my failing tests to develop a code base that was lean and that solved the main issues that the client needed solving. Not only was solving the problem the client had in real time, truly satisfying, it also came with the positive reviewer feedback which is attached in the link below.
